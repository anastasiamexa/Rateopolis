# Rateopolis
An Android application to rate events and stores near you.

As part of the course "Current topics of software engineering - Software for mobile devices", we developed an android application called Rateopolis.

## Features
- Users can create and log into their account, using Firebase Authentication.
- Displays all available events and stores near you.
- View more information for each event or store.
- Search for a specific event or store via text or using the Speech to Text (STT) capability.
- Rate events and/or stores each day.

## Tech
For this application we used the Android Studio environment using Java. The database used is Firebase Realtime Database. In addition,
the Firebase Storage was used to store the images of the events and stores.

## Documentation
The file [Requirement Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Rateopolis/blob/main/Requirement%20Analysis.pdf) contains a detailed description of the analysis made 
before building the app (in Greek).

## Presentation
The file [demo.mp4](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Rateopolis/blob/main/demo.mp4) is a short video demonstrating the usage and the functionality of the application.
